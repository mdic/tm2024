1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So, some 300 years ago, philosophers in Europe instigated a programme for universal human improvement

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that came to be known as the Enlightenment, and they were the designers of their day,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and their programme amounted to a massive vote of confidence in the power of reason,

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
which is thought to have been uniquely bestowed on humankind by its creator,

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to emancipate human beings from their ties to the earth that hold all other creatures captive,

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and to raise them to the heights of civilisation.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And over the ensuing centuries, developments in education, governance, technoscience and medicine

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
underpinned by this Enlightenment philosophy would gather pace and spread around the globe

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
with trade and colonisation, and they would go on to transform the lives of millions of people.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now, I don't think we can deny the contribution of Enlightenment humanism to the common good,

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and yet this has come at a cost in two respects.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:35,000
First, in driving a wedge between humanity and nature, the very earth that had once offered

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:44,000
nourishment and support for human life has come to be seen as a repository or store of resources

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
to be plundered, unloosing an unfettered extraction of materials on an industrial scale,

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
which has ravaged the earth and jeopardised its capacity for renewal.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And second, while the appeal to universal human entitlement serves well the interests of those with the power to lay claim to it,

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
for others the forcible imposition of this claim has meant dehumanisation and enslavement,

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
along with the loss of land, livelihood and even life.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now, as these twin costs have inexorably risen, what began as an agenda for progressive emancipation

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
has morphed into a vicious spiral of environmental destruction and social injustice.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So newer pathologies of humanism, such as corporate neoliberalism and algorithmic surveillance,

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
are only exacerbating the situation, and we already see the results in the form of climatic breakdown,

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
pandemic disease and cyber warfare.

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So I think we currently stand at a conjuncture no less momentous

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
than that which faced our enlightenment forebears of three centuries ago.

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So do we have the courage, as they did, to usher in a new settlement

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,000
that our own descendants, another 300 years from now, will look back upon as equally foundational?

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And if so, what form should it take?

0	10000	So, some 300 years ago, philosophers in Europe instigated a programme for universal human improvement
10000	16000	that came to be known as the Enlightenment, and they were the designers of their day,
16000	24000	and their programme amounted to a massive vote of confidence in the power of reason,
24000	32000	which is thought to have been uniquely bestowed on humankind by its creator,
32000	42000	to emancipate human beings from their ties to the earth that hold all other creatures captive,
42000	46000	and to raise them to the heights of civilisation.
46000	56000	And over the ensuing centuries, developments in education, governance, technoscience and medicine
56000	63000	underpinned by this Enlightenment philosophy would gather pace and spread around the globe
63000	71000	with trade and colonisation, and they would go on to transform the lives of millions of people.
72000	80000	Now, I don't think we can deny the contribution of Enlightenment humanism to the common good,
80000	85000	and yet this has come at a cost in two respects.
85000	95000	First, in driving a wedge between humanity and nature, the very earth that had once offered
95000	104000	nourishment and support for human life has come to be seen as a repository or store of resources
104000	112000	to be plundered, unloosing an unfettered extraction of materials on an industrial scale,
112000	120000	which has ravaged the earth and jeopardised its capacity for renewal.
120000	132000	And second, while the appeal to universal human entitlement serves well the interests of those with the power to lay claim to it,
132000	140000	for others the forcible imposition of this claim has meant dehumanisation and enslavement,
140000	146000	along with the loss of land, livelihood and even life.
147000	159000	Now, as these twin costs have inexorably risen, what began as an agenda for progressive emancipation
159000	167000	has morphed into a vicious spiral of environmental destruction and social injustice.
167000	175000	So newer pathologies of humanism, such as corporate neoliberalism and algorithmic surveillance,
175000	183000	are only exacerbating the situation, and we already see the results in the form of climatic breakdown,
183000	187000	pandemic disease and cyber warfare.
187000	195000	So I think we currently stand at a conjuncture no less momentous
195000	202000	than that which faced our enlightenment forebears of three centuries ago.
202000	208000	So do we have the courage, as they did, to usher in a new settlement
208000	217000	that our own descendants, another 300 years from now, will look back upon as equally foundational?
217000	222000	And if so, what form should it take?
